# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning-based system to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project leverages supervised machine learning models to classify and recommend crops based on real-time soil and weather conditions. It's ideal for modern agriculture solutions where farmers can make data-driven decisions.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest âœ… (Best performer)

## âœ… Model Accuracy

| Algorithm               | Accuracy   |
|------------------------|------------|
| Naive Bayes            | 99.39%     |
| SVM                    | 96.36%     |
| KNN                    | 97.73%     |
| Decision Tree          | 98.33%     |
| Random Forest âœ…        | **99.24%** |

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **File:** `crop_recommendation.csv`
- **Samples:** 2200
- **Columns:**
  - `N` (Nitrogen)
  - `P` (Phosphorus)
  - `K` (Potassium)
  - `temperature`
  - `humidity`
  - `ph`
  - `rainfall`
  - `label` (crop name)

The dataset is clean, balanced, and contains no missing or duplicate values.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

- Label encoding (`label` â†’ `label_num`)
- Train-test split (70%-30%)
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`

---

## ðŸš€ Prediction Function

A reusable function for prediction:

```python
def predict_crop(N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall):
    input_values = np.array([[N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall]])
    prediction = model.predict(input_values)
    return prediction[0]
```

### ðŸ§ª Example Prediction

```python
predict_crop(7, 6, 7, 25.67, 50.24, 8.96, 88.88)
# Output: "ORANGE is the best crop to be cultivated right there"
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

```bash
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

Install them with:

```bash
pip install <requirement>
```

---

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Place `crop_recommendation.csv` in the working directory
3. Run the script:
```bash
python crop_prediction.py
```
